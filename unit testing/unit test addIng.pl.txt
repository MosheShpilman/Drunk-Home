Unitest - Add ingredient functionality

In order to test this module we have created 2 scripts:

* addIngTest.pl - this script expects to receive 2 parameters - ingredient name and value* (0/1 for false/true).
  first step: checking if the ingredient already exists. if exists and value = 1, test passed. else, failed.
  second step: if not exists, try to add and check if was added. if was added, test passed. else, failed.
  note - if cocktail was added during the test, the script will remove it afterwards.

* addIngUnitTesting.pl - this script accept endless number of tests and execute them.
  This script expects to receive cocktails names and values* seperated by space. 

for example, the next command will check the names "fuel", "Whiskey" and "Vodka" , each main on both possibilities - exists and not exist:

./addIngUnitTesting.pl fuel 0 fuel 1 Whiskey 0 Whiskey 1 Vodka 0 Vodka 1
 
.
======================
test 1 where ingredient is fuel:
the ingredient was enter successfully into the DB!
Test OK!

======================
test 2 where ingredient is fuel:
the ingredient was enter successfully into the DB!
unexpected result to test!

======================
test 3 where ingredient is Whiskey:
The ingredient is already in the system
unexpected result to test!

======================
test 4 where ingredient is Whiskey:
The ingredient is already in the system
Test OK

======================
test 5 where ingredient is Vodka:
The ingredient is already in the system
unexpected result to test!

======================
test 6 where ingredient is Vodka:
The ingredient is already in the system
Test OK

======================

Explenation to the tests:

tests 1 and 2 - actual status: the ingredient is not in the database
	test 1 went OK as we entered value=0
	test 2 failed as we entered value=1

tests 3 and 4 = actual status: the ingredient is in the database
	test 3 failed as we entered value=0
	test 4 went OK as we entered value=1

tests 5 and 6 as we explained about tests 3 and 4.
