===================================================================
Using Tests::Simple tests Perl Module
*************************************

Test 1:	Testing form2data function to accept first argument from HTML Form
	Input: "ingName=Brandy"
	Expected Output: "Brandy"

	
1..1
not ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
# 
#   Failed test 'Catching one Argument from Form

#   at ./perltest.pl line 11.
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 1.


***after refactoring***

1..1
ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
# 

Test 2:	Testing form2data function to accept first&second argument from HTML Form
	Input: "ingName=Brandy&altName=Cognac"
	Expected Output: "Brandy.Cognac"


1..2
ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
#

1..2
ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
# 
ok 2 - Catching two Arguments from Form
# 

Test 3:	Testing form2data function to accept first&second&third argument (a checkbox!) from HTML Form
	Input: "ingName=Brandy&altName=Cognac&basic=on"
	Expected Output: "Brandy.Cognac.on"

ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
# 
ok 2 - Catching two Arguments from Form
# 
ok 3 - Catching three Arguments from Form
# 

The test passed perfectly! seems our code can also parse 3 arguments! lets try 4:

	Input: "ingName=Brandy&altName=Cognac&basic=on&category=alcoholic"
	Expected Output: "Brandy.Cognac.on.alcoholic"
1..4
ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
# 
ok 2 - Catching two Arguments from Form
# 
ok 3 - Catching three Arguments from Form
# 
not ok 4 - Catching four Arguments from Form
# 
#   Failed test 'Catching four Arguments from Form
# '
#   at ./perltest.pl line 17.
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 4.

*** after refactoring ***

1..4
ok 1 - Catching one Argument from Form
# 
ok 2 - Catching two Arguments from Form
# 
ok 3 - Catching three Arguments from Form
# 
ok 4 - Catching four Arguments from Form
# 

Thats it! we can now pass the parsed form to our SQL query handling code and input the Ingredient into our DB!
Great Success!
